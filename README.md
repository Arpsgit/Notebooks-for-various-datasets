# Notebooks-for-various-datasets
## Here I'll upload my python notebooks where I will perform data fetching from APIs, data analysis and prediction models on various datasets mostly from the Kaggle.
<br>1. I performed EDA, feature engineering and build a prediction model using RandomForestClassifier on the Famous Titanic Dataset.
<br>2. I fetched and prepared a dataset through API and made five years dataset of daily weather report of Kolkata, from 2017 to 2021.
