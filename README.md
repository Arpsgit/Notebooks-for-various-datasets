# Notebooks-for-various-datasets
## Here I'll upload my python notebooks where I will perform data fetching from APIs, data analysis and prediction models on various datasets mostly from the Kaggle.
<br>1. I performed EDA, feature engineering and build a prediction model using RandomForestClassifier on the Famous Titanic Dataset.

<br>2. I fetched and prepared a dataset through API and made five years dataset of daily weather report of Kolkata, from 2017 to 2021.

<br>3. I performed feature selection on mnist dataset using Genetic Algorithm and compared Simple Genetic Algorithm with Compact Genetic Algorithm.

<br>4. In that Tensors_with_pytorch file I've done basic tensors operations with pytorch.

<br>5. In ANN_MNIST notebook I've build an Artificial Neural Network model using Tensorflow Keras on mnist data set of digit classification.
